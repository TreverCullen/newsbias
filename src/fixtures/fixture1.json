      "text": "President Donald Trump is shaking up his legal team, again.\nAs negotiations continue with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, the president has added a new lawyer and is considering making other changes.\nThe newest addition to the legal team has garnered attention for burnishing Trump on cable TV. Former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova previously argued on Fox News that the Russia investigation was part of a \u201cbrazen plot\u201d by FBI and Department of Justice staffers to frame Trump.\nTrump\u2019s legal team also reached out in recent days to noted D.C. powerhouse Ted Olson, solicitor general under President George W. Bush, but he declined within hours of the news becoming public. Trump is also reportedly in discussions with Emmett Flood, a veteran D.C. lawyer who worked with Bill Clinton during the impeachment.\nThe news contradicts Trump\u2019s tweet on the subject earlier this month, in which he declared that he was not seeking to change his legal representation.\nThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and\u2026..\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 11, 2018\nThe Russia probe is not the only matter on which Trump is getting legal advice.\nThe president\u2019s private lawyers are also currently working through separate lawsuits: They are suing porn star Stormy Daniels for violating a hush agreement about her alleged affair with the president, while also defending Trump in a defamation lawsuit for calling former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos a liar after she accused Trump of sexual assault.\nFormer Playboy model Karen McDougal is also suing the parent company of the National Enquirer, whose chief executive is friendly with Trump, seeking to be released from a legal agreement that bars her from speaking about an alleged affair with the president as well. Trump\u2019s lawyers are not involved in that case.\nHere\u2019s a look at the lawyers representing Trump in the various matters.\nDon McGahn\nAttorney and United States Federal Election Commission member Don McGahn is seen in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Jan. 9, 2017. (Albin Lohr-Jones\u2014Zuma Press)\nAlbin Lohr-Jones\u2014Zuma Press)\nMcGahn is the current White House counsel, the top lawyer tasked with advising the president on legal issues about policies and legislation. But McGahn has been at the center of controversies over Trump\u2019s challenged travel ban, executive orders and the scandal surrounding former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s tenure in the White House, and Trump at one point handed off responsibility of Russia-related issues to his personal attorney. Before becoming White House counsel, McGahn was Trump\u2019s lawyer on the campaign, and he previously served as a commissioner with the Federal Election Commission. McGahn reportedly threatened to quit when Trump asked him in 2017 to fire Mueller, and the president backed down.\nRead More: Inside Trump\u2019s Plan to Dramatically Reshape U.S. Courts\nTy Cobb\nCorporate attorney Ty Cobb in the offices of his law firm, Hogan & Hartson, Jan. 16, 2004. (The Denver Post)\nJerry Cleveland\u2014The Denver Post/Getty Images\nA former federal prosecutor and a white-collar defense lawyer at the law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington, D.C., Cobb was at one point in charge of overseeing the legal strategy and media response to investigations into the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia. Trump has reportedly considered firing Cobb, who repeatedly said during 2017 that the Russia investigation would be finishing soon and encouraged the president to cooperate with Mueller. In September, Cobb was overheard by a reporter talking openly at a Washington restaurant about the investigation.\nJohn Dowd\nJohn Dowd enters federal court in New York, U.S., on Thursday, May 5, 2011. (Bloomberg)\nBloomberg\u2014Bloomberg via Getty Images\nA noted white collar defense attorney in Washington, Dowd joined Trump\u2019s legal team in June. He argued in December that a president cannot obstruct justice, a controversial legal theory that many experts disagree with. And in March, he told a reporter that he hopes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will shut down the Russia investigation, a break from Cobb\u2019s talk of cooperating with Mueller. The remark led to questions about whether the president\u2019s legal strategy on the Russia investigation was moving to a more aggressive stance.\nMichael Cohen\nMichael Cohen, an attorney for Donald Trump, arrives in Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 16, 2016. (AP)\nRichard Drew\u2014AP\nCohen is a personal lawyer, spokesperson and close confidant of Trump\u2019s. He\u2019s been working for Trump for years, closely enough that he has hired his own lawyer to help him with the Russia probe. He\u2019s known as a particularly aggressive advocate on Trump\u2019s behalf, Trump\u2019s \u201cpit bull or consigliere,\u201d as ABC puts it, for threatening legal action against critics, yelling at reporters and vigorously defending his boss on Twitter.\nJay Sekulow\nJay Sekulow, Chief Counsel American Center for Law and Justice, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Feb. 6, 2014. (AP)\nPablo Martinez Monsivais\u2014AP\nSekulow is on Trump\u2019s personal legal team advising him on Russia issues, and one of the lawyers who often appears in television hits. On Sunday on ABC, Sekulow said of Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Russian meeting, \u201cWell, I wonder why the Secret Service, if this was nefarious, why the Secret Service allowed these people in.\u201d The Secret Service responded and said it did not vet the meeting. Sekulow is Chief Counsel for the American Center for Law & Justice and hosts his own talk show, and before joining Trump\u2019s team he had spent his legal career representing conservative groups.\nJoseph diGenova\nJoseph diGenova discusses former president Bill Clinton's pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich on \"Meet the Press\" February 11, 2001. (AP)\nAlex Wong\u2014Getty Images\nTrump added Joseph diGenova, a Washington lawyer and former U.S. attorney, to his legal team in March. Two months earlier, diGenova had gone on Fox News and endorsed the conspiracy theory that the FBI and Justice Department framed Trump. \u201cThere was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn\u2019t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.\u201d It also emerged that during the investigation of President Bill Clinton in 1997, diGenova published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that sitting presidents can be indicted, a legal question that may take on new relevance under Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nMarc Kasowitz\nMarc Kasowitz personal attorney of President Donald Trump makes a statement at the National Press Club, following the congressional testimony of former FBI Director James Comey in Washington, June 8, 2017. (AP)\nManuel Balce Ceneta\u2014AP\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney, Kasowitz has represented Trump for years, including in divorces, bankruptcy cases and the sexual misconduct allegations that surfaced during the presidential campaign.

Hawking's\u00a0work on theoretical physics earned him countless honors, and made him a key voice in understanding our universe.\nHere are five things to know about Hawking's life and career.\n1. He was diagnosed with ALS at 21\nThe disease forced Hawking to remain in a wheelchair and depend on a computerized voice system to communicate.\u00a0According to\u00a0Live Science, the average life expectancy after an ALS diagnosis is three years, with only 5% living 20 years or more. Genetics could have played a key role in Hawking's survival,\u00a0Live Science reports. Studies suggest people diagnosed at a younger age tend to live much longer.\n2. One of his biggest discoveries involved black holes\nWorking with fellow scientist Roger Penrose, he showed Albert Einstein's theory of relativity suggested space and time had a definitive beginning and end. This led to the theory that black holes aren't completely black, but emit radiation and eventually disappear.\nCLOSE\nIf the big bang theory is an explanation on how the universe was created, then what existed before the big bang occurred? Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n3. His book, 'A Brief History of Time,' was a record-breaker\nIn 1988, Hawking published a book targeting non-scientists\u00a0to help explain fundamental questions such as how the universe started and whether it will end. It set a record by spending more than\u00a0five years on\u00a0The Sunday Times\u00a0bestseller list, and was the No. 1 all-time book on their list as of 2014.\n4. He held\u00a012 honorary degrees\nAmong Hawking's other accolades: In 1982, he received the Commander of the Order of the British Empire honor\u00a0and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. He was also named a Fellow of The Royal Society, comprised of\u00a0\"the most eminent scientists, engineers and technologists from the UK and the Commonwealth,\"\u00a0according to the society.\nCLOSE\nProfessor Stephen Hawking has once again warned us about the unbearably hot future of Earth. Veuer's Sam Berman has the full story. Buzz60\n5. He was\u00a0really worried about the future of humanity\nHawking expressed\u00a0concern that\u00a0the world's citizens could consume enough energy to turn Earth into\u00a0a ball of fire within 600 years. That is, unless\u00a0the rise of artificial intelligence\u00a0doesn't get to us first.\nFacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn\nStephen Hawking through the years\nFullscreen\nPost to Facebook\nPosted!\nA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.\nBritish Scientist Stephen Hawking, a celebrated theoretical physicist and cosmologist is the author of \"A Brief History of Time\" and his black hole thermal radiation discovery in 1974 is considered to be one of the most important physics results of the past century.

Bush appointee assigned to Daniels suit against Trump\nTrump team's move to federal court is likely to be challenged.\nBy JOSH GERSTEIN\n03/19/2018 04:10 PM EDT\nUpdated 03/19/2018 08:57 PM EDT\n2018-03-19T08:57-0400\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter\nAdult film actress Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawsuit against President Donald Trump has been assigned to a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush.\nLos Angeles-based U.S. District Judge S. James Otero picked up the case Monday, after lawyers for Trump and a firm controlled by Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen formally removed the case from state court.\nStory Continued Below\nThe suit, filed by Daniels earlier this month in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed before the 2016 election in exchange for a payment of $130,000. The deal called for Daniels to keep quiet about what she told friends was a sexual encounter and ensuing relationship with Trump about a decade earlier, but Daniels\u2019 suit contends that the contract is invalid because Trump never signed it.\nDaniels\u2019 attorney, Michael Avenatti, said on Twitter last week that he believes Trump\u2019s effort to move the case to federal court to be an attempt to preserve an arbitration provision in the agreement. Federal courts often enforce such provisions strictly, while state courts are sometimes more lax about enforcing them.\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.\nSign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning \u2014 in your inbox.\nEmail Sign Up\nBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s effort to force the case into federal court will work.\nIn making the move last week, attorneys for Trump and Cohen\u2019s firm said Daniels \u2014 whose real name is Stephanie Clifford \u2014 is on the hook for more than $20 million in damages as a result of at least 20 violations of the confidentiality agreement she accepted.\nHowever, one legal analyst said Monday that since Daniels\u2019 suit doesn\u2019t seek monetary damages, there\u2019s no basis to move it to federal court.\n\u201cThere has to be more than $75,000 in controversy for a state case to be removed to federal court,\u201d said Wendy Murphy, a Boston attorney and women\u2019s rights advocate. \u201cTeam Trump claims the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 because Daniels could be sued for $20 million for violating the NDA 20 times. But the assessment of how much is in controversy is determined by the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit, not the defendant's response,\u201d she said.\n\"The only legal authority for that $20 million 'amount in controversy' is the NDA, which, according to Team Trump, is enforceable solely by the arbitrator \u2014 not federal court,\" Murphy added later. \"So, it's a number above $75,000, but it's not 'in controversy' in the case.\"\nIf Otero determines the case doesn't belong in federal court, it will be sent back to L.A. Superior Court. Otero was a judge on that court before being confirmed to his current judgeship in 2003.\nOtero, a Republican, was recommended for the federal bench by a bipartisan screening committee in 2002. He has a conservative record in business and environmental cases.\nFourth Estate\nWhat\u2019s the Deal With Stormy Daniels?\nBy JACK SHAFER\nHowever, in 2008, Otero tossed out a lawsuit alleging that a University of California policy discriminated against Christians by denying credit for high school courses based on textbooks that reject evolution and defend the Bible's explanations for natural phenomena.\nAnd in 2005, Otero struck down a local ordinance aimed at banning day laborers from soliciting work on streets and sidewalks.\nOtero is also handling litigation filed by a group of Yemeni citizens who claim to have had visas to emigrate to the U.S. delayed as a result of Trump\u2019s travel ban policies.

The holiday, which this year falls on Tuesday, marks the arrival of spring. It's celebrated by millions across the globe.\n\"The history of Nowruz is rooted in Iran, where for millennia a proud nation has overcome great challenges by the strength of its culture and the resilience of its people,\" Trump said in a statement released Monday. \"Today, the Iranian people face another challenge: rulers who serve themselves instead of serving the people.\"\nJUST WATCHED\nExplaining the Iran nuclear deal\nReplay\nMore Videos ...\nMUST WATCH\nExplaining the Iran nuclear deal 01:20\nHe called out the Iranian regime's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, calling it a \"hostile army that brutalizes and steals from the Iranian people to fund terrorism abroad.\"\nHe accused the guard corps of spending \"Iran's wealth\" to support \"the Assad regime and support militants and terrorists in Syria, Iraq and Yemen\" rather than the \"ordinary Iranians\" who \"struggle economically and find it difficult to celebrate holidays like Nowruz.\"\nRead More\n\"Deceit has become official state policy,\" Trump added. \"To hide the truth, Iran's rulers suppress their own citizens' rights to free assembly, access to information, and equal opportunity. \"\nThe statement came as the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal approaches reauthorization next month. While speaking with reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump provided little clarity on what he will do with the deal.\n\"The Iran deal is coming up.

But he stressed that he did so reluctantly.\nTrump slammed the rushed process to pass the more than 2,200-page bill released only Wednesday. Standing near the pile of documents, the president said he was \"disappointed\" in the legislation and would \"never sign another bill like this again.\"\n\"We're very proud of many of the items that we've been able to get. We're very disappointed that in order to fund the military, we had to give up things where we consider in many cases them to be bad or them to be a waste of money. But that's the way unfortunately right now the system works,\" Trump said at the White House. He added that he \"looked very seriously\" at a veto, but his support for the military spending levels \"overrode\" his concerns about the bill.\nTrump teased a veto a day after the White House had said he would sign the legislation despite his misgivings. He raised the risk of a government shutdown only hours before the midnight Friday deadline. Then the president, who enjoys creating tension and drama, announced he would not veto the bill in an event carried on live television.\nKevin Lamarque | Reuters\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at an event to sign Congress' $1.3 trillion spending bill in the Diplomatic Room of the White House in Washington, March 23, 2018.\nTrump highlighted the portions of the bill he supports: the nearly $80 billion increase in defense spending, a $1.6 billion boost to border security funding and a cash injection to fight the opioid epidemic. The border money will go mostly toward surveillance technology and fencing similar to structures that already exist on the southern border. The amount of funding came in far below what the president wanted.\nIn a tweet Friday morning, Trump said he was \"considering a VETO\" because the proposal did not extend protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants or fully fund his proposed border wall.\nTrump tweet\nThe president's tweet threw more chaos into the process to keep the government running Friday, even after it looked like Trump's signature would be a sure thing. Vice President Mike Pence offered support for the bill Thursday. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney answered \"yes\" on Thursday when asked if Trump would sign the bill.\n\"Why? Because it funds his priorities,\" he told reporters.\nThe legislation, which both chambers of Congress passed with bipartisan support, would fund the government through the end of September. It would significantly boost military spending and increase funding for border security, infrastructure and efforts to fight the opioid epidemic.\nIt also includes measures meant to strengthen gun sale background checks and improve school safety.\nWhen Trump threatened a veto, many lawmakers had already left Washington. Some are in Rochester, New York, for the funeral Friday of longtime Rep. Louise Slaughter, who died last week. The Senate had adjourned and was not expected to take up legislative work again until April 9.\nWhile Trump cheered the military funding levels, he was irked by the level of border security funding. While Republicans and the president himself have said the bill funds Trump's \"wall,\" the money goes to miles of new fencing similar to existing structures.\nTrump, who has tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, reportedly wanted $25 billion in long-term wall funding in exchange for protections for the young immigrants. Democrats and some Republicans have sought to extend the DACA program. Trump reportedly did not want to give up to 1.8 million immigrants a pathway to citizenship as part of that deal, as Democrats wanted.\nOn Friday, Trump claimed Democrats do not want to extend the legal protections for the immigrants.\n\"I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats, who are using you for their own purposes,\" he said.\nSome notable Republicans who opposed the spending bill encouraged Trump to torpedo it on Friday after his veto threat. Earlier, House Freedom Caucus Vice Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio told CNBC the veto threat \"is great\" and said he hoped the president followed through on it.\n\"I think he got a full understanding of how bad this legislation is. \u2026 This is not even close to what the American people elected us to do,\" the hardline House conservative said.\nJordan pushed back on GOP claims that the bill funded the border wall, asking, \"Why do you think [House and Senate Minority Leaders] Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are smiling ear to ear?\"\nEarlier Friday, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told Trump to \"please\" veto the legislation, calling the spending levels \"grotesque.\"\nCorker tweet\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., whom Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell persuaded not to delay the Senate vote on the bill, also urged Trump to \"veto this sad excuse for legislation.\"\nPaul tweet\nAt least one Democrat \u2014 Rep. Ted Lieu of California \u2014 said he supported a veto. He criticized the rushed process by which Congress passed the legislation.\nLieu tweet\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., had worked this week to win Trump's support for the plan. He described it as a win for the president because it boosts Defense Department funding, authorizes more money to fight the opioid crisis and puts more money toward border enforcement.\n\"This funds the wall, fixes the military, fights opioids and does the things that we said,\" Ryan said Thursday on Fox News' \"Fox & Friends,\" a show Trump frequently watches and tweets about.\nRyan also went to the White House on Wednesday as Trump was unsure about whether to support the spending bill. After the president spoke with Ryan and McConnell, the White House issued a statement saying he backed the legislation.\nTrump's tweet Friday morning caught Ryan by surprise, according to a GOP source who declined to be named. The speaker is in his home state of Wisconsin for the Easter recess, and spoke to the president by phone at about 9:30 a.m., a little more than a half hour after Trump's tweet.\nRyan emphasized \"all the wins\" in the bill, particularly military spending, and felt encouraged after the call, the source added.\n\u2014 CNBC's Ylan Mui and Eamon Javers contributed to this report\nWATCH: This is what happens when the U.S. government shuts down\nshow chapters\nThis is what happens when the U.S. government shuts down\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8:46 AM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 | 02:07",

      "text": "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump argued Friday that Democrats have stood in the way of DACA recipients gaining permanent legal status, while casting Republicans as would-be saviors.\n\"The Republicans are with you, they want to get your situation taken care of,\" Trump said at the White House, as he complained about the $1.3 trillion spending bill program, speaking directly to recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \"The Democrats fought us, they just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.\"\nBut as Congress left town increasingly unlikely to pass any major immigration legislation before November's midterms, the White House has repeatedly rejected deals to fix DACA, the Obama-era policy he ended then implored Congress to save.\nHere's a timeline of DACA under Trump:\nSeptember 5, 2017: Trump announced an end to the DACA program, which protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation. President Barack Obama instituted the work permits and protections in 2012.\nRead More\nSeptember 13: Trump has dinner with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi at the White House, after which the two Democrats say they agreed in broad strokes to a DACA-border security deal that doesn't include Trump's wall. Trump initially seems on the same page, then the White House and Republicans walk it back. Trump tweets about how \"good, educated and accomplished\" DACA recipients are.\nOctober 8: The White House unveils what it calls its priorities for a DACA deal, a laundry list of aggressive conservative immigration measures that Democrats and a handful of Republicans rejected as rife with poison pills.\nNovember 1: After a terrorist attack in New York City, Trump begins to emphasize ending the diversity visa lottery and family-based migration.\nNovember 2: Republican lawmakers meet with Trump at the White House and rule out attaching any DACA deal to year-end funding bill before a possible shutdown.\nDecember 21: Lawmakers pass government funding into the new year and leave town without a deal, despite Democrats' previous pledges to not go home without one.\nJanuary 9: Trump holds bipartisan meeting at the White House that cameras televise for nearly an hour. He indicates multiple times he is willing to compromise on DACA, despite some contradictions within the meetings, and says \"when this group comes back -- hopefully with an agreement -- this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it.\" The so-called \"four pillars\" also come out of this meeting -- that a deal shall include DACA, family-based migration, the diversity lottery and border security.\nJanuary 9: Federal court puts hold on Trump's plan to end DACA, ordering renewals of permits to continue but no new applications.\nJanuary 11: After months of meetings, Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham go to the White House to propose to Trump a compromise worked out by their group of six bipartisan senators. The offer includes a path to citizenship for eligible young immigrants, the first year of Trump's border wall funding, ending the diversity visa lottery and reallocating those visas, and restricting the ability of former DACA recipients to sponsor family.\nTrump and the White House invite hardline Republicans to the meeting and he rejects the deal, making his now-infamous \"shithole countries\" comment in the process.\nJanuary 19: House before a government funding deadline, Schumer and Trump meet for lunch at the White House. Schumer offered Trump the upwards of $20 billion he wanted for his border wall in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eligible immigrant population. The deal is rejected, and government shuts down at midnight.\nJanuary 22: Government reopens after Republicans Graham and Jeff Flake secure a public commitment from Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell to hold a future immigration floor vote. Bipartisan negotiations resume.\nJanuary 25: White House releases its proposal for a DACA deal under the four pillars, which includes a generous path to citizenship for eligible immigrants, but also a number of impossible-to-swallow provisions for Democrats and some Republicans under the auspices of family-based migration and border security.\nFebruary 14: A bipartisan group of senators unveils a compromise plan, which includes $25 billion for the border, a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants, cuts to one slim category of family-based migration and prevents the parents who brought their children to the US illegally from ever being sponsored for citizenship by those children.\nFebruary 15: White House goes all out to stop the bipartisan compromise deal, which fails to get the necessary 60 votes in the Senate, with 54 votes.\nFebruary 26: Supreme Court declines to take up an immediate appeal of court decisions resuming DACA renewals, ensuring no deportations of DACA recipients for months and taking pressure of Congress.\nMarch 14: With roughly a week to go before the major government spending package known as the omnibus must pass, White House suddenly signals a desire for a DACA-border deal. Publicly, the White House says they oppose a temporary fix.\nMarch 22: Congress passes an omnibus without DACA, virtually ensuring it will not be addressed before midterms.\nMarch 23: Trump signs the omnibus, rails on Democrats for, he says, not caring about DACA.\nCNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

I sincerely believe politicians should have training in this area too.\"\nMany celebrities who don't necessarily become politicians themselves are often keen to make their political beliefs known, sometimes by actively campaigning for a particular candidate.\nKaty Perry and Beyonce were among those to openly back Hillary Clinton during the US presidential election of 2016.\nImage copyright Getty Images\nImage caption Katy Perry publicly demonstrated for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nBut Matteo Bergamini, from the political advocacy Shout Out UK, argues that relying on celebrities to make politics more \"attractive\" to young people is a \"tired trope\".\nWriting for the Huffington Post, he claims it \"perpetuates the myth that young people are simply not interested enough in their own futures to get involved unless someone wraps it up in a shiny bow. Surely our young people deserve more credit than that?\"\nSo, is it a good idea for celebrities to dabble in politics, and how many have managed to make the transition?\nHere are just some of the celebrities who have turned their hand to politics - some more successfully than others...\n1.

      "text": "Supported by\nBook Review | Nonfiction\nWas the 2016 Election a Game of \u2018Russian Roulette\u2019?\nBy STEVEN LEE MYERSMARCH 14, 2018\nContinue reading the main story Share This Page\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with President Donald Trump at the G20 in 2017. Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times\nRUSSIAN ROULETTE\nThe Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump\nBy Michael Isikoff and David Corn\n338 pp. Twelve. $30.\nIt is an article of faith among President Trump\u2019s most ardent detractors that he is a corrupt blowhard catapulted to the office by a devious intelligence operation ordered up by America\u2019s supervillain, the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin.\nOn the other end of the country\u2019s hopelessly splintered political spectrum are those who join Trump in rebutting the idea, often with the caps lock on: \u201cFAKE NEWS!\u201d \u201cNO COLLUSION!\u201d\nSomewhere in between are those \u2014 and let us presume to count among them the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 who are determined to establish what exactly Russia did to influence the outcome of the presidential election of 2016.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nFor that, it seems, we will have to wait for Mueller\u2019s band of investigators to complete their work. His latest indictment inched ever closer to the Kremlin, targeting 13 Russians, including one close enough to the top to be nicknamed \u201cPutin\u2019s cook,\u201d but still stopped short of implicating the Russian leader or establishing the collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign that critics are certain took place.\nContinue reading the main story\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nIn the meantime comes \u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d a new book by two veterans of Washington political journalism, Michael Isikoff and David Corn, whose subtitle promises to reveal \u201cthe inside story of Putin\u2019s war on America and the election of Donald Trump.\u201d\nAlas, it does not \u2014 at least so far as offering foolproof evidence of Putin\u2019s involvement, or his motives. \u201cFor all the public controversy,\u201d they write two pages before the end of their book, \u201cthere was still much about Putin\u2019s cyberattacks that was cloaked in mystery, especially what had happened in Russia.\u201d\n\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d is, thus, not an investigative breakthrough as much as a new contribution to that well-worn genre: the granular, source-on-the-wall election diary. On that score, they have produced the most thorough and riveting account so far \u2014 riveting, that is, as long as you don\u2019t mind falling into paroxysms of political outrage and dismay.\nAlthough the authors make their view clear from the start, referring to Russian help as the perceived \u201coriginal sin\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency, it is to their credit that they present both campaigns in an unfavorable light. The book will surely infuriate readers on either side of what should be the most urgent question facing the nation today: the vulnerability of our democratic institutions to Russian manipulation.\nFor aggrieved Clinton supporters, reading \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d will be like reliving a nightmare. Trump supporters, too, should wince at the cringe-worthy embarrassments that would have derailed any other candidate.\nIn one scene inside Trump Tower, the candidate\u2019s aides debate how to respond to the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which the future president boasts about grabbing women by their genitals. According to the authors, Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, her face reddening and eyes filling with tears, urged her father to make a full-throated apology. He did not. He simply dismissed what he said as \u201clocker room banter\u201d without denying anything he did.\nIt should have been a moment for Team Clinton to celebrate a knockout blow to Trump\u2019s insurgency \u2014 except that the video landed on an inauspicious day for them.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nBarely an hour earlier, the director of national intelligence and secretary of homeland security issued a statement saying that the intelligence community was \u201cconfident that the Russian government directed\u201d the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system. The subsequent leak of thousands of emails was a tactic \u201cconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\u201d\nThis was the Watergate burglary of the internet age, yet the revelation was all but drowned out by the release of the tape. \u201cThe Clinton staffers hit the phones, calling reporters they had worked with, urging them to give more attention to the Russia story. They weren\u2019t having much luck.\u201d\nPhoto\nAnd still to come was the third October surprise of the day. WikiLeaks announced that it would begin dribbling out thousands of emails to and from John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, that proved hugely embarrassing to the candidate.\nThat day \u2014 Oct. 7 \u2014 may prove to be a turning point in American history. It was, by some unearthly coincidence, also Vladimir Putin\u2019s 64th birthday.\n\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d is best when describing how the country\u2019s intelligence agencies were slow to recognize Russia\u2019s effort and the frustration among Clinton\u2019s supporters of the failure of the administration, the F.B.I. and the media to trumpet it for what it was. (Some reporters did, in fact, including Corn and Isikoff, but much more became clear only after Trump\u2019s victory.)\nNewsletter Sign Up\nContinue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

In it we reported on the F.B.I.\u2019s inability to substantiate what appeared to be ties between the Trump Organization and a private Russian bank, Alfa, even as its agents were following an array of other leads. Some of them were detailed in the \u201cdossier\u201d of Christopher Steele, the former British agent hired to conduct opposition research.\nWhile evidence of many accusations remains unclear, the authors argue that the article and headline wrongly focused on the absence of proof rather than the main point, which was that there was an investigation into \u201cpossible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate.\u201d\nThere are, in the end, no heroes in \u201cRussian Roulette.\u201d The bureau\u2019s director, James B. Comey, deserves significant scrutiny (and he has his own book coming). During the investigation into her private email server, Clinton and her staff were so suspicious of the bureau that when agents first came to the Brooklyn headquarters to inform them of the Russian hacking, the campaign manager, Robby Mook, refused to meet them, fearing they were there to ask about Clinton\u2019s emails.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nThe suspicions boiled over when Comey made an 11th-hour statement that the bureau was reviewing \u201cnew\u201d emails found in a separate investigation, into Anthony Weiner, the disgraced husband of Clinton\u2019s close aide Huma Abedin. By doing so, Comey hurled a thunderbolt into the election only days before the vote \u2014 something aides quoted anonymously claim he wanted to avoid.\nHistorians may long debate who had a bigger influence on the outcome: the F.B.I. director or the Russian leader.\nFor anyone who believes in the better angels of American politics, \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d is a depressing book. The Russian hacking, it is now clear, simply exploited the vulgarity already plaguing American political campaigns, which churn on spin and strategy (and money) far more than vision or values.\nThe book does have its flaws. The simplistic vilification of Russia \u2014 without evidence or better context \u2014 reinforces the view of some thoughtful Russians that Americans have become irrationally hostile toward the country and even the culture. The sourcing is also sloppy in places. The authors are respected journalists, and one can trust their use of anonymous sources or not, but in the span of four pages describing the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013, for example, they quote four different ones. There is \u201ca Miss Universe associate\u201d (whatever that means), \u201ca Miss Universe official,\u201d \u201ca Miss Universe staffer\u201d and \u201canother Miss Universe staffer.\u201d\nThe \u201cMiss Universe official\u201d states that only Putin could have approved holding the pageant in Moscow, which is absurd. Putin controls much in Russia, but only in the fevered imagination of a pageant official does he dictate the location of beauty contests. The \u201canother Miss Universe staffer\u201d suggests Trump winnowed the finalists in his pageants by rejecting dark-skinned contestants and those who \u201csnubbed his advances.\u201d That is an explosive accusation to attribute to a single source among a muddle of them.\nStill another anonymous source reveals one of the book\u2019s most significant revelations. A Russian insider had been providing the American Embassy in Moscow with unconfirmed but what turned out to be prescient information about Putin\u2019s inner circle around the same time Trump was presiding over the pageant. Among the disclosures was the racially tinged disdain senior Russians felt for Barack Obama, all dutifully reported back to Washington in top-secret cables.\nThis source \u2014 described not as an intelligence asset but as a sympathetic political insider, who as a young man had been \u201cheartened by Ronald Reagan\u2019s anti-Soviet rhetoric\u201d \u2014 told his interlocutor as early as 2014 that the Kremlin was planning to undermine democracy in the West. It was, the authors suggest, one of many missed signals of what was coming.\n\u201cAnybody who had any doubt about Putin\u2019s intentions,\u201d the source\u2019s American interlocutor is quoted as saying, \u201cjust wasn\u2019t reading what we reported.\u201d\nSteven Lee Myers is a reporter in The Times\u2019s Beijing bureau and the author of \u201cThe New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @stevenleemyers.\nFollow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

What\u2019s the Russia Connection?\nBy BEN PROTESS, MIKE McINTIRE, STEVE EDER and JESSE DRUCKERMARCH 17, 2018\nContinue reading the main story Share This Page\nContinue reading the main story\nPhoto\nPresident Trump boarding Air Force One this month. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed his company for documents related to Russia. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\nThe investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election has expanded to include President Trump\u2019s family business, with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, subpoenaing the Trump Organization for documents related to Russia.\nFor more than 30 years, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to conduct business in Russia. He traveled to Moscow in 1987 to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have met with Russian developers and government officials on multiple occasions in search of joint ventures.\nBut the company says nothing has come of it. Mr. Trump tweeted in January last year, shortly before his inauguration: \u201cI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA \u2014 NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201d\nSo what about the Trump Organization\u2019s Russian connections might be of interest to Mr. Mueller?\nPhoto\nFelix Sater, right, with Mr. Trump in 2005. Mr. Sater discussed securing money for a Trump Moscow project through a Russian bank under sanctions. Credit Cyrus McCrimmon/The Denver Post, via Getty Images\nThere Was a Moscow Hotel Deal in the Works During the Campaign\nPerhaps the closest Mr. Trump came to launching a real estate project in Russia was during the presidential campaign, when he signed a letter of intent in late 2015 for a Trump hotel to be built in Moscow. Ultimately, the deal never materialized.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nIn email exchanges with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had previously helped develop Trump SoHo in New York, talked about securing financing for the Moscow project from VTB, a major state-owned Russian bank under American sanctions. He also mused about how the deal, if supported by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, would \u201cfix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce & business are much better and more practical than politics.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\n\u201cI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote in one of the emails.\nMr. Trump signed the letter of intent with Andrey Rozov, a developer of retail and residential projects in the Moscow region. If the deal went through, Mr. Trump would receive a $4 million upfront fee in exchange for licensing his name, and his company would manage the completed hotel.\nBy January 2016, the project seemed to have stalled. At one point, without success, Mr. Cohen emailed an aide to Mr. Putin seeking help jump-starting it. There is no evidence the Kremlin provided any assistance for the project.\nThe Trump Organization has said that it received no government approvals or financing and that the effort was abandoned in early 2016.\nPhoto\nMr. Trump with Aras Agalarov, left, a Russian real estate developer, and Gabriela Isler, the 2013 Miss Universe. The pageant that year was held in Moscow. Credit Irina Bujor/Kommersant.ru, via Associated Press\nMr. Trump Took Miss Universe to Moscow and \u2018Met the Top People\u2019\nMr. Trump\u2019s business opportunities in Russia got little traction until he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013.\nA father-son pair of real estate developers, Aras and Emin Agalarov, paid nearly $20 million to license the Miss Universe name, bringing the contest to their Crocus City Hall in Moscow. As an owner of the pageant, Mr. Trump flew to Russia in November 2013 to participate. He became friendly with his partners, who were known to have been helpful to the Kremlin.\nThe visit left an impression on Mr. Trump and had him contemplating future endeavors with the Agalarovs.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\n\u201cI had a great weekend with you and your family,\u201d Mr. Trump posted on Twitter in a message to Aras Agalarov. \u201cYou have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,\u201d he wrote, before referring to Mr. Agalarov\u2019s son, a pop star: \u201cEMIN was WOW!\u201d\nWhile the plans for the tower were apparently shelved during the campaign, Mr. Trump and the Agalarovs maintained their friendship.\nIn June 2016, a publicist for Emin Agalarov requested that Donald Trump Jr. meet with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. That meeting, at Trump Tower in New York, first reported by The New York Times last July, included other campaign officials and has been the subject of considerable scrutiny.\nAfter the disclosure of the meeting, the president downplayed his ties to the Agalarovs in an interview with The Times. But in a September 2015 interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show,\u201d he had made the Miss Universe pageant seem far more important.\n\u201cI called it my weekend in Moscow,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people. I can\u2019t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.\u201d\nPhoto\nDeutsche Bank, which has done business with Mr. Trump over the years, paid more than $600 million in penalties over money laundering.

His casino and hotel businesses had suffered some bankruptcies, and his lenders were grumbling that he had stiffed them.\nBut one giant German bank stepped up as a willing partner.\nOver the years, that institution, Deutsche Bank, offered Mr. Trump more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, The Times reported last year.\nNewsletter Sign Up\nContinue reading the main story\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Mr. Trump had bought it just a few years earlier for about $41 million. Credit Steve Mitchell/Associated Press\nA Russian Oligarch Bought a Trump Mansion at a High Price\nDmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian billionaire oligarch, paid $95 million for Mr. Trump\u2019s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., one of two sources of income from Russians that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have said were reflected in his income tax returns. (The other was $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.)\nThe Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons.\nMr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem.\nMr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property.\nAt the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure. He potentially owed Deutsche Bank $40 million after not paying off a loan for his Chicago hotel and tower.\nThe Florida property later featured prominently in Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s divorce.\nMr. Rybolovlev\u2019s wife sought control of the mansion, saying he had bought it partly to hide money from her in the divorce, a claim he denied.\nHe has since demolished the mansion and divided the property into different parcels that he is selling. The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.\nA spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market. The spokesman also said that the property was acquired by a family trust \u201cspecifically and explicitly for investment purposes,\u201d and that depending on the sale price of the final lot, the investment might \u201cend up yielding a decent return.\u201d\nPhoto\nA golf writer said that at a Trump course in Charlotte, N.C., in 2013, Eric Trump told him, \u201cWe have pretty much all the money we need from investors in Russia.\u201d Credit Jacob Biba for The New York Times\nThere Were Boasts That Russian Money Helped Pay for Golf Courses and Other Projects\nIn the past decade, the Trump Organization has bought and refurbished several golf courses around the world, but the financing behind those deals remains something of a mystery. A respected golf writer says that Eric Trump, a son of Mr. Trump\u2019s who is now helping to run the Trump Organization, told him the money came from Russia.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\nLast year, during an interview on Boston public radio, the golf journalist James Dodson recounted a conversation he had had with Eric Trump in 2013 on a newly opened Trump golf course in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Dodson said he had asked Mr. Trump about the company\u2019s sources of funds, and Mr. Trump told him, \u201cWe have pretty much all the money we need from investors in Russia.\u201d\nEric Trump has denied making the comment about Russia, but several of Mr. Dodson\u2019s friends and colleagues confirmed that Mr. Dodson relayed the anecdote to them shortly after the conversation took place.\nIt was not the first time that one of Mr. Trump\u2019s sons made a similar claim. In 2008, at a real estate conference in New York, Donald Trump Jr. said: \u201cIn terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York.

      "text": "Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and current counsel at the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n(CNN)It's becoming increasingly clear who President Donald Trump really wants to represent him in the Robert Mueller investigation -- and there's a good reason he can't have him.\nWhen John Dowd quit this week as lead counsel on Trump's legal team and the President made an effort to recruit \"deep state\" conspiracy theorist and conservative legal commentator Joseph diGenova to the team, the conclusion could only be that Trump wants to go to war against Mueller, using the tactics favored by his onetime mentor Roy Cohn.\nIn effect, the President wants to wage an aggressive, and probably dirty war, on the special counsel. Cohn, having died in 1986, isn't available. But there may be other lawyers who can fill that role.\nIn the early years of his Manhattan real estate career, Trump was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Cohn's who had gained fame decades earlier as counsel to the notorious McCarthy committee in the 1950s.\nNavarro: Two old white men beat each other up in a bar -- this week's episode of 'Trumpworld'\nCohn was a true believer in scorched earth legal tactics. The widely reviled and feared lawyer would willingly use the legal equivalent of chemical weapons to achieve his goals. Trump was so taken with the toughness of his legal consigliere that he, according to The New York Times, kept an 8-by-10 photograph of the feared barrister in his desk drawer to terrorize those who resisted his demands.\nRead More\nAccording to the Times, Trump even said, \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" last year when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, helping eventually to open the door for the appointment of a special counsel.\nThe Republican President who really made America great\nThere are no reports of Trump threatening anyone with photos of the lead attorneys on his current legal defense team, which until Thursday included Dowd and the handlebar-mustachioed Ty Cobb. The public posture of the defense team in recent months suggests these lawyers have counseled patience and measured cooperation with the Mueller investigation in the belief that any other tactic would make the President look guilty in the eyes of Mueller and the public.\nThe tactic also reflects the pragmatic assessment that Mueller has the subpoena power of a federal grand jury empowering him to get anything legally relevant to the Russia election interference probe and has been authorized in writing by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to pursue \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\nI tweeted about diversity and got hammered by haters\nThe President may well be disturbed by the special counsel's most recent subpoena of the Trump Organization and its potential to cross his red line, opening for investigational scrutiny any potential secrets of his business (and perhaps even Trump's tax returns).\nThe shake-up on Trump's legal team is likely to continue, as indicated by the discussion of adding diGenova to the team. Whether DiGenova or his wife, Victoria Toensing, survive the White House vetting process remains to be seen. Beyond the usual background checks, the President's personal assessment about how they look on television, more specifically on Fox News television, undoubtedly will be part of the process.\nOne thing is crystal clear. New recruits to the legal team will have to be hard-edged conservatives who are aggressive fighters in the Cohn mode if they expect to fill the seats vacated by Dowd and other defense team members as Trump reshapes his legal strategy.\nEvery job is safe in the White House -- until it's not\nThe re-emergence of hard-liners such as Michael Cohen and Marc Kasowitz, who continue to advise the President from the shadows despite controversial actions both lawyers have taken in the past, also suggests that a new and tougher defense strategy is in the works.\nCohen attempted to purchase the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels with his own money and was also allegedly involved in the \"catch and kill\" agreement used to silence former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal. (Cohen says he has no recollection of communications regarding McDougal and her agreement with the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc.) She was interviewed Thursday by CNN's Anderson Cooper about an alleged 10-month affair with the President. Both women say they had sexual relationships with Trump while he was married to Melania Trump. Representatives for the President have denied there were such affairs.\nKasowitz had largely disappeared from the public view after his last controversial attack on an individual who dared to criticize him in an email.\nKasowitz replied via emails that threatened: \"I'm on you now. You are f-----g with me now Let's see who you are Watch your back, b---h,\" .... \"Call me. Don't be afraid, you piece of s---. Stand up. If you don't call, you're just afraid.\" .... \"I already know where you live, I'm on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro. ...\"\nFollow CNN Opinion\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\nThrough the years Kasowitz has represented Trump using scorched earth legal tactics in a host of contentious cases, including Trump's divorce proceedings, bankruptcy proceedings, the Trump University litigation as well as accusations that Trump engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with a number of women. Trump has denied all of these claims.\nTrouble for Trump if Mueller meets Stormy\nThe signs are clear. While the White House has repeatedly said there are no plans to fire Mueller, Trump is shifting to an aggressive legal defense strategy, and the departure of Dowd portends more shake-ups in the legal team.\nWatch for forceful attacks on Mueller, including calls for his dismissal, shake-ups at the Justice Department and FBI as well as presidential noncooperation with the Mueller probe. The ghost of Roy Cohn is in the air, but perhaps Trump should be careful. By the time of his death, Cohn had been disbarred for dishonesty and his career shattered.\nA better spirit to invoke might be that of Richard Nixon, who learned that going to war with a special prosecutor is the path to resignation and disgrace rather than vindication.",
