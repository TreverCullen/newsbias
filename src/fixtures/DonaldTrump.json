On March 6, 2018, Daniels filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump in California Superior Court, claiming, among other things, that the nondisclosure agreement never came into effect because Trump never signed it. The suit, which is a complaint for declaratory relief, seeks a judgment declaring that no agreement was formed and for costs of the suit and other relief the Court might deem proper.",
